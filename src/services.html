                    A structured cabling system is a complete system of cabling and associated hardware, which provides a comprehensive telecommunications infrastructure. This infrastructure serves a wide range of uses, such as to provide telephone service, Wireless connection, CCTV equipment or transmit data through a computer network. We understand that every structured cabling system is unique. This is due to variations in: The architectural structure of the building, which houses the cabling installation; The cable and connection products; The function of the cabling installation; The types of equipment the cabling installation will support -- present and future; The configuration of an already installed system (upgrades and retrofits); Customer requirements; and Manufacturer warranties.We are Certified Installers giving our client 15 year warranty on structured cabling installation materials used.

                    <h2>Computer Room Cleaning</h2>
                    <p>Cleaning and dust removal in a data centre, computer room, server room or comms room is vital to the reliable operation of equipment containing mission-critical data. After construction and major installations or upgrades, a detailed cleaning is essential. Annual sub-floor and regularly scheduled above-floor services keep the room free from harmful dust and contaminants that can infiltrate equipment, cause overheating and decrease operating life.Whether your data center or computer room is just a closet or a mega-center, it needs to be cleaned to maintain the health of the equipment, the health of the personnel and the environmental aesthetics. Our technicians perform three basic services separately, or in combinations, that are designed to keep you computer room running at peak performance. These three services are: Exterior Hardware Cleaning, Tops of Floor Cleaning, and Underfloor Plenum Cleaning. Combinations of these services are usually performed at scheduled intervals, ranging from once per year, Quarterly to once a day. These same services and variations are performed in response to floods, or other disasters, or to prepare for equipment installation after construction.</p>

                    <h2>Exterior Hardware Cleaning</h2>
                    <p>ICT Infrastructure Solutions LTD uses proven techniques to remove dirt, dust, and other contaminants from your controlled environment. Not only the ones you can see, but more importantly the hidden ones you can't see. Data Clean's trained technicians use specialized, environmentally friendly cleaning solutions – time tested for use on the materials used in the manufacture of modern technical equipment. Our HEPA filtered vacuums are certified to 0.3 microns and remove even the smallest of micro-particles from your facility.Every possible step has been taken to guard against damage or disruption to your operation. Before our Technician is sent into the field he must successfully complete a comprehensive training program.During training, they are taught specific cleaning techniques and shown the proper procedures to use when working around your delicate electronic equipment.</p>

                    <h2>Tops of Floor Cleaning</h2>
                    <p>Computer room flooring is designed to dissipate static electricity by providing a conductive path to ground. Dirt on top of and ground into computer flooring greatly reduces the floor's ability to dissipate static. Improper cleaning can cause your floor to delaminate or chip. </p>

                    <h2>Underfloor Plenum Cleaning</h2>                    
                    <p>The lifeline of any computer room is the plenum beneath its raised flooring. This plenum delivers cool, filtered air to the sensitive equipment above. Unfortunately, because of gravity, the plenum is also the area most prone to dirt and dust. Allowed to accumulate, these contaminants will be swept up and carried to your equipment by the circulating air conditioning so vital to your equipment's operation. The impact of contaminated airflow includes clogged circuitry, increased risk of fire, accidental fire suppressant discharge, and miscellaneous health problems.Underfloor cleaning service helps protect your equipment from these and other hazards. Our cleaning also satisfies many insurance audits, and may help reduce the cost of insurance.</p>
